# Registration Disabled - Users Must Be Invited

## Changes Made to Prevent Public Signup

### 1. Authentication Routes (`routes/auth.php`)

- **Commented out registration routes** to prevent access to signup functionality
- Registration GET and POST routes are now disabled
- Login and password reset functionality remains intact

### 2. Login Page (`resources/js/pages/auth/login.tsx`)

- **Removed "Sign up" link** from the login form
- **Added password reset link** for users who have forgotten their passwords
- **Cleaned up unused imports** (Link, Github, Separator)

### 3. Registration Controller (`app/Http/Controllers/Auth/RegisteredUserController.php`)

- **Modified `create()` method** to redirect to login with error message
- **Modified `store()` method** to prevent registration attempts
- **Cleaned up unused imports** and dependencies
- **Changed return type** to RedirectResponse for proper type safety

### 4. Welcome Page (`resources/js/pages/welcome.tsx`)

- **No changes needed** - already only shows login button for unauthenticated users
- No signup links present

## How Users Join the SACCO

### For Administrators (Chairperson):

1. Navigate to the invitation system in the admin panel
2. Send invitations to new members via email
3. Invited users receive email with invitation link

### For Invited Users:

1. Receive invitation email with unique token
2. Click invitation link to set up account
3. Complete registration through invitation process
4. Access SACCO system as a member

## Benefits of Invitation-Only System

### Security:

- **Controlled access** - only approved individuals can join
- **Prevents spam accounts** and unauthorized registrations
- **Maintains member integrity** within the SACCO

### Administrative Control:

- **Chairperson approval** required for all new members
- **Proper onboarding** process for new SACCO members
- **Tracking of who invited whom** for accountability

### SACCO Compliance:

- **Membership management** aligns with SACCO governance
- **Know Your Customer (KYC)** compliance through invitation process
- **Proper member verification** before system access

## Testing the Changes

### 1. Verify Registration is Disabled:

- Try accessing `/register` URL directly → Should redirect to login with error
- Check login page → No signup links should be visible
- Attempt to POST to registration endpoint → Should be blocked

### 2. Verify Invitation System Works:

- Admin can create invitations
- Invitation emails are sent correctly
- Users can complete registration via invitation link

### 3. Error Messages:

- Users attempting to register see appropriate error message
- Clear guidance to contact administrator for invitation

## Configuration

No additional configuration needed. The system now operates as invitation-only by default.

### Environment Variables

All existing mail configuration remains the same for sending invitations:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your_email
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="noreply@sacco.local"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="SACCO System"
```

## Rollback (If Needed)

To re-enable registration:

1. Uncomment routes in `routes/auth.php`
2. Restore original RegisteredUserController functionality
3. Add signup link back to login page

However, for a SACCO system, invitation-only membership is the recommended approach.
